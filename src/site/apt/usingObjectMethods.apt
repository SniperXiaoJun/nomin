Using Object's methods in mappings

  Sometimes it needs to map methods of the Object class. The method should be mapped using special syntax as follows:

+---
  a.options["originalHash"] = b."hashCode()"
  a.options["stringRepresentation"] = b."toString()"
  a.options["className"] = b."getClass()".name
+---

  Enclosing in quotas is required to prevent calling the method on an internal Nomin's component.
