Caching mapped instances

  Nomin by default caches mapped instances. It allows to improve performance in case of frequently repeating values to be
  mapped. Also caching mapped objects serves as a cycle detection mechanism to prevent infinite loop in case of bidirectional
  references.

  Caching can be disabled, this is required in rare cases.
